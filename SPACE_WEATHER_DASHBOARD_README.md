- **Status indicators**: Color-coded operational state

## üìä How to Interpret the Visualization

### Spatial Relationships
- **Scale**: Logarithmic scaling for visibility (actual distances would make satellites invisible)
- **Orbits**: Different satellite altitudes shown as distinct orbital shells
- **CME Propagation**: Cone expands from Sun toward Earth at realistic speeds

### Color Coding System
- **üü° Solar elements**: Golden/yellow for Sun and solar phenomena
- **üîµ Earth elements**: Blue/cyan for Earth and terrestrial references  
- **üü† CME elements**: Orange/red for coronal mass ejections
- **üü¢ Safe satellites**: Green indicators for unaffected spacecraft
- **üî¥ Impacted satellites**: Red/orange for spacecraft in CME path

### Animation Cues
- **Orbital motion**: Satellites follow realistic orbital mechanics
- **CME expansion**: Cone grows at proportional solar wind speeds
- **Pulsing effects**: Indicate active alerts or selected objects
- **Glow effects**: Highlight important elements and interactions
